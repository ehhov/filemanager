To do:

  * Read syntax colors from LS_COLORS.

  * Find out the minimum required versions of Vim and Neovim.

  * Add documentation.

  * Think of optimizations for sorting by name.


Known bugs:

  * Vim's sort() and :sort cannot combine sorting by name and number:
        file1 file10 file2  -x->  file1 file2 file10

  * Vim's rename() fails to rename missing symlinks.

  * Attempt to move directory inside itself using Vim's rename() not
    only fails but creates an empty executable file at destination path.

  * Timestamps fail when changes occur in less than a second.

  * Searching for patterns like \.txt$ fails because of the s:separator
    and file type indicator at the end.
