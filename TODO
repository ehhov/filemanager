To do:

  * Read syntax colors from LS_COLORS.

  * Find out the minimum required versions of Vim and Neovim.

  * Add documentation.


Known bugs:

  * Vim's sort() and :sort cannot combine sorting by name and number:
        file1 file10 file2  -x->  file1 file2 file10

  * Vim's rename() fails to rename missing symlinks.

  * Timestamps fail when changes occur in less than a second.
