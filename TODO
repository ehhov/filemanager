To do:

  * Read syntax colors from LS_COLORS.

  * Find out the minimum required versions of Vim and Neovim.

  * Think of optimizations for sorting by name.

  * Solve broken syntax highlighting after applying color schemes.


Known bugs:

  * Vim's sort() and :sort cannot combine sorting by name and number:
        file1 file10 file2  -x->  file1 file2 file10

  * Vim's rename() fails to rename missing symlinks.

  * An attempt to move a directory inside itself using Vim's rename()
    not only fails but creates an empty executable file at the
    destination path.

  * Timestamps fail when changes occur within less than a second.

  * Searching for patterns like \.txt$ fails because of the s:separator
    and file type indicators at the end.
