filemanager - file manager plugin for Vim and Neovim
====================================================

filemanager is a simple yet functional tree explorer and file manager plugin
for Vim and Neovim. filemanager is written from scratch to be as
straightforward as possible while providing a rich feature set to cover all
tasks of a file manager built into a text editor. Its main focus is to give
the user full control over all actions and never do anything unexpected.


Features
--------

 * Browse directories, open and fold them one-by-one, collectively,
   or recursively. The directory tree is automatically updated when entering
   filemanager buffers.

 * Open files from the directory tree, by name, or find them in 'path'.
   Window placement can be finely configured.

 * Open files in external programs (using xdg-open by default).
   Specify file names to always open in external programs.

 * File names of any complexity are always handled correctly.
   The same applies to syntax (file type) highlighting as well.

 * Run shell commands and open terminal windows in the tree root and in
   the directory under the cursor.

 * Select files and directories interactively or by regex/glob.
   Perform actions on selected items: copy, move, rename, delete, or use in
   an arbitrary shell command.

 * Rename files in bulk directly by editing buffer lines of the directory
   tree.

 * Finely configure sorting order for some directories specifically.

 * Hide files ignored by Git.

 * Filter the directory tree by regex/glob with support for nested and
   exclusive filters.

 * Save filemanager buffers in bookmarks that store all configuration options
   and the directory view. Bookmarks are saved and shared between Vim
   sessions.

 * Cursor position is maintained based on path during all actions.

 * filemanager allows independent buffers with the same tree root directory.

 * One primary filemanager buffer per tab and however many auxiliary ones are
   allowed.

However, there are some things filemanager is not:

  * It's not the fastest file manager in the world,

  * It's not the most portable one.

To open filemanager windows, use the global :L, :V, or :H commands or simply
edit a directory.


Installation
------------
filemanager has no dependencies apart from Vim or Neovim itself.
To install it, use a plugin manager of your choosing.

Alternatively, if you would like to manage the plugin yourself, run

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ehhov/filemanager \
          ~/.vim/pack/user/start/filemanager
    $ vim -u NONE -c 'helptags ALL' -c 'quit'

for Vim or

    $ git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/ehhov/filemanager \
          ~/.local/share/nvim/site/pack/user/start/filemanager
    $ nvim -u NONE -c 'helptags ALL' -c 'quit'

for Neovim.
